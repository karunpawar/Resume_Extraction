# Resume_Extraction
We are attempting to extract basic information of the candidate from a resume and return the result in json.
In order to extract the information from resume, we need to find the pattern of the information we are trying to extract like for the name of the candidate, we see very often that the name is the first entry of the resume so we are picking up first few words of the resume and identifying them as first and last name.
We wrote regular expressions to extract the different details from resume.
